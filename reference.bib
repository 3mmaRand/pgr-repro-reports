  abstract  = "R Markdown: The Definitive Guide is the first official book
               authored by the core R Markdown developers that provides a
               comprehensive and accurate reference to the R Markdown
               ecosystem. With R Markdown, you can easily create reproducible
               data analysis reports, presentations, dashboards, interactive
               applications, books, dissertations, websites, and journal
               articles, while enjoying the simplicity of Markdown and the
               great power of R and other languages. In this book, you will
               learn Basics: Syntax of Markdown and R code chunks, how to
               generate figures and tables, and how to use other computing
               languages Built-in output formats of R Markdown:
               PDF/HTML/Word/RTF/Markdown documents and
               ioslides/Slidy/Beamer/PowerPoint presentations Extensions and
               applications: Dashboards, Tufte handouts, xaringan/reveal.js
               presentations, websites, books, journal articles, and
               interactive tutorials Advanced topics: Parameterized reports,
               HTML widgets, document templates, custom output formats, and
               Shiny documents. Yihui Xie is a software engineer at RStudio. He
               has authored and co-authored several R packages, including
               knitr, rmarkdown, bookdown, blogdown, shiny, xaringan, and
               animation. He has published three other books, Dynamic Documents
               with R and knitr, bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical
               Documents with R Markdown, and blogdown: Creating Websites with
               R Markdown. J.J. Allaire is the founder of RStudio and the
               creator of the RStudio IDE. He is an author of several packages
               in the R Markdown ecosystem including rmarkdown, flexdashboard,
               learnr, and radix. Garrett Grolemund is the co-author of R for
               Data Science and author of Hands-On Programming with R. He wrote
               the lubridate R package and works for RStudio as an advocate who
               trains engineers to do data science with R and the Tidyverse.",

  author       = "Peng, Roger D",
  abstract     = "The intentional ambiguity of the R language, inherited from
                  the S language, is one of its defining features. Is it an
                  interactive system for data analysis or is it a sophisticated
                  programming language for software developers? The ability of
                  R to cater to users who do not see themselves as programmers,
                  but then allow them to slide gradually into programming, is
                  an enduring quality of the language and is what has allowed
                  it to gain significance over time. As the R community has
                  grown in size and diversity, R's ability to match the needs
                  of the community has similarly grown. However, this growth
                  has raised interesting questions about R's value proposition
                  today and how new users to R should be introduced to the
                  system. I will discuss some lessons learned from my
                  experience teaching R to new users and from observing the
                  evolution of the language over the past 20 years.",
